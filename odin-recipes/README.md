# Odin Recipes Project

Welcome to the **Odin Recipes** project, part of the Foundations curriculum from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This is a beginner-friendly HTML project focused on building a simple and functional recipe website using only basic HTML.

## Project Description

This project involves creating a multi-page website that features a main index page and individual pages for several recipes. Each page includes structured content such as headings, paragraphs, images, and lists, demonstrating an understanding of fundamental HTML concepts.

The main goals of this project are to:
- Practice using semantic HTML elements
- Understand how to structure a basic website
- Link between multiple HTML pages
- Embed images and format content clearly
- Lay the foundation for future web development projects

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I have demonstrated or will demonstrate the following skills:

- Proficiency with basic HTML structure and syntax
- Use of semantic tags (`<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, etc.)
- Linking multiple pages using relative paths
- Embedding and formatting images with alt text
- Organizing content clearly and accessibly
- Using Git for version control and GitHub for project hosting

## Reflection

Completing this project gave me a solid understanding of how HTML works at a foundational level. I gained hands-on experience with structuring content, linking pages, and maintaining clean, readable code. It also reinforced the importance of semantic HTML and accessibility.

This is my first step toward becoming a full-stack developer, and Iâ€™m excited to build on these basics as I progress through the rest of The Odin Project.
