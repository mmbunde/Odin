        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Carnitas recipe features tender, flavorful pork shoulder slow-cooked with garlic, onion, orange juice, and a blend of 
            Ancho, Guajillo, and √Årbol chiles. Rubbed with oregano, cumin, and salt, the pork is cooked until fall-apart tender, 
            then shredded and crisped in lard for rich, golden edges. Perfect for tacos, the result is a juicy, smoky, and slightly citrusy dish with irresistible crispy bits.
